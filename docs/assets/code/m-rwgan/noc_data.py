"""Minimal, numpy-only data helpers for the paper-figure scripts.

Just enough of the M-RWGAN data layer to load the historical ``Data_AX``
pickles under ``figures/data/`` and derive the per-topology summaries the
figures plot. No TensorFlow, no spektral: the figure scripts never touch the
GCN/critic path, only the stored simulation results.

``Data_AX`` must be importable (not redefined ad hoc) to unpickle those
files. They were pickled in contexts where ``Data_AX`` lived in the
top-level ``__main__`` module, so each pickle records its class as
``__main__.Data_AX``; ``load_data_ax_dataset`` registers this class under
``__main__`` before loading so a plain ``pickle.load`` succeeds regardless
of how the caller is invoked.

Four of the inputs are too large for git (~1.2 GB in total). For each of
them ``figures/bake/`` writes a small, git-tracked artifact under
``figures/data/derived/`` holding exactly the reduction the figures consume,
and the loaders here look there first, so a plain clone rebuilds every
figure with no download, while pointing a script's ``--…-path`` override at
the raw archive still works and still takes precedence.
